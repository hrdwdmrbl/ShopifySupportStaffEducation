          <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
            The root of these issues is that Shopify's API abstracts away critical information. Apps cannot distinguish
            their inventory contribution from other sources (like Shopify POs) and cannot see the underlying ledger
            structure. This forces developers to operate blindly, leading to hidden, uncorrectable inventory states.

              Issue 1: "Stuck" Incoming Inventory After App Uninstallation
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="p-6 space-y-4">
            <p>
              When a merchant uninstalls an app, Shopify immediately severs all permissions, preventing the app from
              making any further changes. Although apps are required to delete their data upon uninstallation, any
              "incoming" inventory adjustments they created—whether positive or negative—remain on the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the app's connection is terminated, it has no opportunity to clean up or "zero out" these leftover
              quantities. This leaves the inventory in a "stuck" state. The merchant is unable to resolve these
              lingering incoming inventory figures because the app that created them is no longer present to manage
              them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 italic">
              The only way for a merchant to fix this is to reinstall the app solely for the purpose of having the app
              correct the inventory. This problem persists even if an app is behaving perfectly, as it is a fundamental
              limitation of the uninstall process COMBINED with a decision by Shopify to not "zero out" incoming
              inventory from apps when they are uninstalled.

              Issue 2: The Inability of Apps to "Zero Out" Their Own Inventory
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="p-6 space-y-6">
            <p>
              The fundamental problem is that an app cannot isolate and remove only its
              <strong>own contribution</strong>
              to a product's "incoming" inventory. This issue stems from the behavior of Shopify's
              <code>inventoryAdjustQuantities</code> API mutation.
            </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-800 mb-3">Key Components of This Issue:</h3>
              <ul class="space-y-3">
                <li class="list-item-custom">
                  <strong>Net Total vs. App-Specific Inventory:</strong> The API only allows an app to see and modify
                  the <strong>net total</strong> incoming inventory for a product. This net figure is the sum of all
                  incoming sources, including Shopify Purchase Orders (POs) and any adjustments from apps.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item-custom">
                  <strong>Lack of Visibility:</strong> An app has no way to see the specific incoming quantity
                  contributed by Shopify POs or other sources. It also cannot see its own true value stored by Shopify;
                  it can only see the final net total.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-800 mb-3">The "Zeroing Out" Paradox in Action:</h3>
              <div class="border-l-4 border-slate-200 pl-4 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                <p>1. A product has <strong>+10 units</strong> incoming from a Shopify PO.</p>
                <p>2. An app attempts to remove its influence by using the API to set its incoming quantity to 0.</p>
                <p>
                  3. However, the API interprets this as a command to set the
                  <strong>net total incoming quantity</strong> to 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. To make the math work (10 - 10 = 0), Shopify forces the app's contribution to become
                  <strong>-10 units</strong>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Therefore, the act of setting the app's value to "0" perversely results in it becoming a negative
                number. The app is then "stuck," as it cannot know the correct value needed to truly offset its
                influence. This is caused by the "lack of visibility". This behavior puts apps in an impossible
                situation where they cannot function correctly.

              Issue 3: Hidden "per-Ledger" Balances Complicate Zeroing Out
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="p-6 space-y-4">
            <p>
              A further complication exists even when an app attempts to zero itself out. Shopify tracks incoming
              inventory not just as a total, but on a
              <strong>per-<code>ledgerDocumentUri</code> basis</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem occurs if an app does not use the identical <code>ledgerDocumentUri</code> when both
              increasing and decreasing inventory:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-600">
              <li>An app adds +10 units with <code>ledgerDocumentUri: "doc-A"</code>.</li>
              <li>
                Later, it attempts to cancel this by subtracting 10 units, but uses
                <code>ledgerDocumentUri: "doc-B"</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Instead of canceling each other out, this creates two separate, hidden ledger entries: one for `+10` and
              another for `-10`. While the app's net incoming quantity may appear as `0` in the UI, these underlying
              non-zero balances remain and can block other critical store functions, such as deactivating a location.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-300 bg-red-50 p-4 text-red-800">
              <strong>
                This behavior is undocumented and the per-URI balances are completely invisible to both apps and
                merchants.
              </strong>
              It is impossible for a developer to diagnose or correct this issue without Shopify Support manually
              providing a report of the hidden ledger entries.

              Q: Is this caused by an app failing to delete its purchase orders?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A: No. The issue is not dependent on app-created purchase orders. Issue 2 can occur even if an app is
              never uninstalled. The core problem lies in how the API calculates and exposes incoming inventory, not in
              app data management.

              Q: Why can't the app just fix the negative inventory?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A: An app cannot see its own incoming inventory value versus Shopify's. It only sees the net total
              incoming. To "fix" a -10 value it doesn't know exists, it would need to know the Shopify PO quantity (+10)
              and add that amount. The API provides no way for the app to get this information.

            </h3>
            <p>
              A: No, that is incorrect. This mutation is allows for an app to programmatically adjust "Incoming"
              inventory quantities. This issue has absolutely nothing to do with "Available" inventory.

              Q: Is the app deleting or nullifying Shopify Purchase Orders?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A: No. There is no API for an app to delete Shopify Purchase Orders. The app's action of setting the net
              incoming inventory to zero has the <em>net effect</em> of zeroing the incoming quantity from a Shopify PO.

              Q: Can't the merchant just correct the "stuck" inventory themselves?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A: No. There is no interface in the Shopify admin for a merchant to manually edit or remove the individual
              incoming inventory contributions from a specific app. Their only recourse is to reinstall the app and have
              it attempt a correction, which is not truly possible due to the "zeroing out" paradox.

            </h3>
            <p>
              A: It's an identifier for a specific inventory adjustment. Shopify treats each URI as a self-contained
              ledger. If an app doesn't use the exact same URI to decrease inventory as it did to increase it, the
              balances won't cancel out, creating hidden non-zero entries. This is critical because this behavior is
              undocumented and the data is not visible through the API or UI, making it impossible for developers to
              handle correctly without Shopify's direct assistance.

            </h3>
            <p>
              A: No. An app might be able to avoid issues 2 and 3 if they use that API exclusively. However, once an app
              uses the regular API, then it is susceptible all of the issues. I don't know how Shopify handles inventory
              transfers when an app is uninstalled.

              A: While specific examples can illustrate the problem, the issue itself is not with a specific merchant,
              variant, or timeframe. It is a fundamental flaw in the behavior of the Shopify API itself. Focusing on
              individual cases distracts from the need to address the systemic problem.
